From#ShimmerEVM, testnet triumphs, introducing IOTA 2.0 and our vibrant ecosystem, we're gearing up for an exhilarating year ahead! \ud83d\udc47\ud83e\uddf5\n\ud83d\udd17https://lnkd.in/dav7cSqy1/ This year marked a significant chapter for IOTA with the introduction of#ShimmerEVM, bringing#DeFito the IOTA ecosystem. Let's explore the impact ShimmerEVM has had on our vibrant ecosystem\ud83d\udc47\n\n2/ The ShimmerEVM testnet, launched in March, recorded over 1 million transactions within 1 month. In May, the Treasures of Shimmercampaign added over 10 million transactions, highlighting the testnet's robustness\ud83d\udcaa\n\n3/ The release of ShimmerEVM in September led to a massive surge in Total Value Locked (TVL), reaching $4.8 million in October. Fun Fact: our ever-expanding ecosystem now boasts 40 active projects \ud83d\udc4f\n\n4/ In December, ShimmerEVM integrated withLayerZero Labs, extending its reach in the broader crypto space & fostering seamless cross-chain communication \u26a1\n\n5/ In preparation for 2024, we laid the groundwork for#IOTA2.0 with extensive content introducing the protocol upgrade. What's more: the Stardust upgrade in October brought a tokenization framework to the IOTA mainnet, allowing anyone to mint tokenized assets on L1 \ud83e\ude99\n\n6/ This year, IOTA also made waves in the UAE with the creation of the IOTA Ecosystem DLT Foundation, registered withAbu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). Ready to spark growth, it's on a mission to cultivate the IOTA ecosystem across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia\ud83c\udf10\n\n7/ Finally, 2023 saw the adoption of#MiCAin the EU, providing much-needed clarity to the crypto industry. The IOTA Foundation actively promoted regulatory frameworks, organized roundtables, and remains committed to ongoing regulatory advocacy efforts \ud83e\udd1d\n\n8/ With L2 EVM-compatible smart contracts hitting the mainnet, the#IOTA2.0 testnet launch, and the integration of smart contracts into IOTA's L1 on the horizon, the future looks incredibly promising. Buckle up, everybody! \u2728",

Watch the video on how it works, and read the summary below:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Unlocking Scalability: parallel transaction processing allows#IOTAto handle a significantly larger number of transactions simultaneously, catering to high-volume demands without sacrificing performance.\n\u23f1\ufe0f Faster Transaction Confirmation: With parallel processing, transactions can be confirmed more quickly. This is especially valuable in scenarios where timely transaction verification is essential, such as supply chain management, real-time payments & more.\n\ud83c\udf10 Network Efficiency: By distributing the transaction processing load across multiple nodes, the network becomes more efficient and resilient. Congestion & bottlenecks are prevented, ensuring that the network functions even during activity surges. \n\ud83e\udd1d Enhanced Reliability: Even if some nodes experience issues or downtime, the network as a whole can continue functioning, thanks to the distributed processing approach. This fault tolerance contributes to a more robust and dependable ecosystem.\n\ud83d\udce6 Support for Complex Use Cases: Parallel processing opens the door to to use cases like multi-party interactions and interdependent transactions. This opens up possible innovations in the#SupplyChain&#Defiindustries\n\ud83c\udf31 Future-Proofing via Scalability:#IOTA2.0's integration of parallel processing isn't just about today's requirements\u2014it's a strategic anticipation of tomorrow's demands, essential for the long-term sustainability and growth of any#DLT.\n\nDo you want to dig deeper into#IOTA2.0's parallel processing structure?

Our approach aims to fosters long-term investment, sustainably \ud83c\udf31. But how does Mana enable this? And how do you obtain it? Watch the video and read further.\n\nFirstly, everyone - validators and users alike, is rewarded with Mana. Even the simplest act of holding tokens generates Mana rewards, since you are a part of the IOTA ecosystem through long-term investment. \n\nNext way to earn Mana is by actively participating in IOTA 2.0 as a validator. Anyone can validate: all you need is to run a node and stake any amount of $IOTA tokens, and you contribute directly to the network's security.\n\nFinally: you don't want to go all in, but still want support IOTA 2.0's decentralization? There's an in-between solution just for you. Delegate your Mana to a validator, and for this action, receive your share of Mana in return. \n\nHow much? You can find out yourself using the Mana Rewards Calculator.  See what you can earn through these 3 methods over time: \ud83d\udd17https://lnkd.in/de42mAhz. Still need to learn more?

        "post_content": "\ud83c\udf10In#IOTA2.0, you\u2019re incentivized to support the network in two ways: either by validating blocks or delegating your voting power, thanks to#Mana. Here's how it works \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nValidating: anyone can become a validator. All you need is to run a node and temporarily lock up $IOTA tokens. Validators play a crucial role verifying and confirming transactions, enhancing trust and reliability in the network. Once you've become a validator, you have a chance to become part of a voting committee. Your voting power is determined by the amount of locked up $IOTA tokens you have.\nWhy become a validator? As you validate transactions and contribute to the network's security, you are compensated for your efforts with Mana. This additional stream of Mana can be used to perform more transactions, by gaining more throughput on the network.\n\nYou can also support the network by delegating your voting power to validators. It's a simple & rewarding way to participate in the network. You earn passive Mana, support network decentralization & contribute to protocol governance without the need of extra technical knowledge.\n\n To understand more about validating and delegating, read the full blog post here:https://lnkd.in/dDzphkjZ",

The AU's strategy is focused on creating a digitally empowered Africa, where connectivity is a reality for everyone. Alongside this, the AfCFTA is working towards a single digital market, aiming to ease cross-border trade. A key component of this plan is the AfCFTA's Digital Trade Protocol, a groundbreaking initiative that is currently under development, which seeks to standardise regulations across the continent, thereby boosting digital trade in goods and services.\n\nAs e-commerce rises and digital technologies become more ingrained in our daily lives, Africa stands on the cusp of a digital revolution and is well-positioned to benefit from these initiatives. These initiatives are more than just policies; they are keys that will open new markets for African businesses, expand customer bases, enhance their competitiveness, and provide a platform for entrepreneurs, especially women and youth, to thrive in the digital economy by equipping them with necessary tools to participate in a digital economy. \n\u00a0\nSo, where does TradeMark Africa (TMA) fit into this? In this evolving scenario, TMA is actively working to create a favorable digital trade environment through innovation. This includes supporting digital services from public agencies, offering digital skills training, and promoting private sector-friendly digital technologies. TMA's work is about bridging the digital divide and enhancing Africa's participation in the global digital economy. \u201cWe are ensuring that businesses aren\u2019t just trading but trading smartly and efficiently,\u201d asserted Sirali. \n\u00a0\nTMA\u2019s initiatives go beyond traditional methods. We're exploring new technologies like distributed ledger technologies (DLT) (for example Trade Logistics Information Pipeline withIOTA-https://www.tlip.io/) and focusing on building digital capacity among Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Most importantly TMA advocates for inclusive digital policies, ensuring that all stakeholders, are involved in shaping the future of digital trade. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about moving forward; it\u2019s about ensuring that everyone, including marginalised groups, has a say in the direction we\u2019re headed,\u201d said Sirali.\u00a0Operating in 14 countries across Africa, TMA collaborates with local service providers to maximise its impact, aiming for sustainable digital trade development across the continent.",
