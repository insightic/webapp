By leveraging the stability, security, and regulatory compliance of CeFi and the transparency and accessibility of DeFi, NEOPIN aims to resolve trust and security issues present in both financial sectors. The platform uses its native NEOPIN token (NPT) and allows users to participate in liquidity pools, earning rewards for their contributions through features like staking, swap, and yield farming. NEOPIN is also exploring additional products, including Play-to-Earn games, Stake-to-Earn, Mine-to-Earn, and NFT services, while prioritizing security and regulatory compliance with systems like KYC and AML.",
